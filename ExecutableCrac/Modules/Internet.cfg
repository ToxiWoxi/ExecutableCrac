echo ---- Command: rate
echo ---- Impact: Game accuracy and performance
echo If this is set up incorrectly, it may increase your packet loss resulting in game
echo stutter and inconsistencies. The rate command works in bytes, which is 8 bits. ISPs
echo usually rate their services in kilobits or megabits. These are equal to 125 bytes and
echo 125000 bytes respectively. You can find your download speed at speed test websites
echo such as "https://www.speedtest.net" and use the equation below to find the rate you
echo should be using. The highest accepted rate is '786432'
echo Equation:              (Download speed in megabits - 1) * 125000

echo ---- Commands: cl_interp, cl_interp_ratio
echo ---- Impact: Game responsiveness and hit-reg
echo Unlike the rate command, these values cannot be changed while on a server. It is also
echo recommended to change the rate rate before this one as it can affect ping. To change
echo this accurately, you must know your usual ping. Since your ping can change, it is
echo recommended to find the average from 3 to 5 competitive games and round down to the
echo nearest whole number. Since your ping can vary, it is recommended to use one of these
echo four presets:
echo Ping                   Commands
echo 1 - 29                 "cl_interp 0.007813;cl_interp_ratio 1"
echo 30 - 59                "cl_interp 0.015625;cl_interp_ratio 1"
echo 60 - 89                "cl_interp 0.015625;cl_interp_ratio 2"
echo 90+                    "cl_interp 0.03125;cl_interp_ratio 2"
//
// Lag Compensation and Prediction
//
echo 
echo ---- Commands: cl_lagcompensation, cl_predict
echo ---- Impact: Game responsiveness and hit-reg
echo With these disabled, servers will not take your ping into account for your shots,
echo causing most accurate shots at a moving target to miss. Always keep these enabled,
echo even in a LAN environment.
