echo
echo ---- Command: rate
echo ---- Impact: Game accuracy and performance
echo If this is set up incorrectly, it may increase your packet loss resulting in game
echo stutter and inconsistencies. The rate command works in bytes, which is 8 bits. ISPs
echo usually rate their services in kilobits or megabits. These are equal to 125 bytes and
echo 125000 bytes respectively. You can find your download speed at speed test websites
echo such as "https://www.speedtest.net" and use the equation below to find the rate you
echo should be using. The highest accepted rate is '786432'
echo Equation:              (Download speed in megabits - 1) * 125000

echo
echo ---- Commands: cl_interp, cl_interp_ratio
echo ---- Impact: Game responsiveness and hit-reg
echo Unlike the rate command, these values cannot be adjusted while on a server. Setting
echo cl_interp to 0 should result in the server calculating this for you. It is recommended
echo to change the rate before this one as that can affect ping. To change this accurately,
echo you must know your usual ping. Since your ping can change, find the average from 3 to 5
echo competitive games. 
echo It is recommended to use one of these presets:
echo Ping                   Commands
echo 1 - 29                 "cl_interp 0.007813  ;  cl_interp_ratio 1"
echo 30 - 59                "cl_interp 0.015625  ;  cl_interp_ratio 1"
echo 60 - 89                "cl_interp 0.015625  ;  cl_interp_ratio 2"
echo 90+                    "cl_interp 0.03125   ;  cl_interp_ratio 2"
echo Auto                   "cl_interp 0         ;  cl_interp_ratio 1"

////    Lag Compensation and Prediction

echo 
echo ---- Commands: cl_lagcompensation, cl_predict
echo ---- Impact: Game responsiveness and hit-reg
echo With these disabled, servers will not take your ping into account for your shots,
echo causing most accurate shots at a moving target to miss. Always keep these enabled,
echo even in a LAN environment.
