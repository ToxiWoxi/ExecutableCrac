echo ---- Commands: cl_interp, cl_interp_ratio
echo ---- Impact: Game responsiveness and hit-reg
echo Unlike the rate command, these values cannot be adjusted while on a server. Setting
echo cl_interp to 0 should result in the server calculating this for you. It is recommended
echo to change the rate before this one as that can affect ping. To change this accurately,
echo you must know your usual ping. Since your ping can change, find the average from 3 to 5
echo competitive games. 
echo It is recommended to use one of these presets:
echo Ping                   Commands
echo 1 - 29                 "cl_interp 0.007813  ;  cl_interp_ratio 1"
echo 30 - 59                "cl_interp 0.015625  ;  cl_interp_ratio 1"
echo 60 - 89                "cl_interp 0.015625  ;  cl_interp_ratio 2"
echo 90+                    "cl_interp 0.03125   ;  cl_interp_ratio 2"
echo Auto                   "cl_interp 0         ;  cl_interp_ratio 1"
