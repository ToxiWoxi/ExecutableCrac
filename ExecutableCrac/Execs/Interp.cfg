echo Unlike the rate command, these values cannot be changed while on a server. It is also
echo recommended to change the rate rate before this one as it can affect ping. To change
echo this accurately, you must know your usual ping. Since your ping can change, it is
echo recommended to find the average from 3 to 5 competitive games and round down to the
echo nearest whole number. Since your ping can vary, it is recommended to use one of these
echo four presets:
echo Ping                   Commands
echo 1 - 29                 cl_interp 0.007813  ;  cl_interp_ratio 1
echo 30 - 59                cl_interp 0.015625  ;  cl_interp_ratio 1
echo 60 - 89                cl_interp 0.015625  ;  cl_interp_ratio 2
echo 90+                    cl_interp 0.03125   ;  cl_interp_ratio 2
